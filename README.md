# Linkedin Boolean Builder

## Summary

A simple script to quickly create Linkedin search strings. I have made a slightly more complicated version of this which is used by myself and colleagues. Unfortunately I am not comfortable sharing the upgraded version as it reveals some of Google's secret methods of finding the worlds best Software Engineers. The other version includes a string builder for Google’s internal database Ghire (slightly more complex than Linkedin) and more shortcuts, so nothing too fancy either.

The application differs from most string builders as they usually involved multiple text bars and buttons. This one works using just one input bar and all commands can be executed from the keyboard, making it faster and easier to use. Try it out [here.](https://hamishpk.github.io/)

## Language Choices

This was built in Javascript/Bootstrap  with help from a friend who knew a lot more about Javascript than I do. I’d have preferred to have written this in python as it’s my preferred language, however using python for such a simple web application would have been a huge overkill. Plus playing around with Javascript was pretty interesting :)

## Improvements

This application could be improved by giving users the ability to set and save their own strings and add shortcuts tailored to their market focus. It would also be useful to be able to build strings for other platforms such as Github and Stackoverflow. I may some time add these improvements, probably then using a python/flask back end with a SQL database which would be uniquely accessed from a login page.
